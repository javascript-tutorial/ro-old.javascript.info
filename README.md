## Structure

Every chapter, an article or a task resides in its own folder.

The folder is named `N-url`, where `N` – is the number for sorting (articles are ordered), and `url` is the URL-slug on the site.

The folder has one of files:

- `index.md` for a section,
- `article.md` for an article,
- `task.md` for a task formulation (+`solution.md` with the solution text if any).

A file starts with the `# Title Header`, and then the text in Markdown-like format, editable in a simple text editor. 

Additional resources and examples for the article or the task, are also in the same folder.

## Translation Tips

The translation doesn't have to be word-by-word precise. It should be technically correct and explain well.

If you see that the English version can be improved -- great, please send a PR to it.

### Text in Code Blocks

- Translate only comments.
- Don't translate anything else -- strings, variables.


Example:

```js
// Example
const text = "Hello, world";
document.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;
```

✅ DO (translate comment):

```js
// Ejemplo
const text = 'Hello, world';
document.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;
```

❌ DON'T (translate string or class):

```js
// Ejemplo
const text = 'Hola mundo';
// ".hello" is a class
// DO NOT TRANSLATE
document.querySelector('.hola').innerHTML = text;
```

### External Links

If an external link is to Wikipedia, e.g. `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript`, and a version of that article exists in your language that is of decent quality, link to that version instead.

Example:

```md
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a programming language.
```

✅ OK (en -> es):

```md
[JavaScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) es un lenguaje de programación.
```

For links to MDN, that are only partially translated, also use the language-specific version.

If a linked article has no translated version, leave the link "as is".
